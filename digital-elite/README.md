# LAYOUT FRONT-END

The proposal is to build a front-end layout as accurate as possible, based in a mockup of a hypothetical company (which is in this file). It doesn't matter how you approach it.

## BONUS

- Make the site responsive.
- Add features like Animations. (For example: Visual number count on page load etc.)
